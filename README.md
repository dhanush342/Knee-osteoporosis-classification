# Knee Osteoporosis Classification

This is my project for Knee Osteoporosis Classification.

# ðŸ¦´ Knee Osteoporosis Detection Using ResNet-50 and Deep Learning

This project presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting knee osteoporosis from X-ray images using the ResNet-50 architecture. It is designed to support early and accurate diagnosis using computer vision and transfer learning techniques.

# ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
Model: ResNet-50 with transfer learning
Task: Binary classification â€“ Normal vs Osteoporotic knees
Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
Evaluation: Accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, precision & recall
